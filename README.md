This is my first simple responsive webapp that heavily relies on jQuery.
This app has a dummy JSON array with a simple {key: value} structure.

Its features include :
  1. Scale according to device width.
  2. An intuitive UX for editing and creating new key value pairs.
  3. Change to a mobile friendly UX for devices with max width 768px.
  4. Handling of long tap event for ease of use in mobile mode.
  5. A search feature which highlights the search substring in the list items.
  6. Accept few predefined keyboard shortcuts, like "ctrl+s" for save and "ctrl+f" for find.
